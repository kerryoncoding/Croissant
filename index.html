      <p>
        Historical evidence attributes Austrian entrepreneur August Zang with
        introducing and popularizing the kipferl, the prototype of the
        modern-day croissant, to France. In 1838, Zang opened the first Viennese
        bakery in Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
        Located at 92 Rue Richelieu on the Right Bank (the right side of the
        Seine river in Paris), Zang‚Äôs upscale boulangerie specialized in bread
        and pastries from his native Vienna, most notably the kipferl. With the
        aid of his patented steam oven, Zang‚Äôs kipferl were noticeably flakier
        than the traditional pastries French people were accustomed to at the
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kipferl quickly became popular and many inspired French imitators.
        As the fashionable new pastries became more common, the French began
        referring to them as croissants due to their crescent shape.
